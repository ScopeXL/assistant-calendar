/**
 * A new Sunroom on the server (ADR 0028): the live stream's hello names the server's version.
 * When it isn't the version this page was built from, the page says so and reloads itself
 * fresh, with no service worker and no cached files in the way, so the new build comes straight
 * from the server. Once per server version, so a proxy still serving the old page can't make it
 * loop; and not while someone is in the middle of something, for 10 minutes at most. The phone's
 * "New version" pill and the wall's 3 AM rule stay for a screen that has no stream.
