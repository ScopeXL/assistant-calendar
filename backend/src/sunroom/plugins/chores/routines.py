"""Routines (UX §4 "Routine runner", §6 "A kid runs a bedtime routine"): short checklists a kid
runs on their own, morning or bedtime. A check is kept for its day, so a routine starts fresh
each day; finishing one is kept once a day, with the stars it gave. Old checks are pruned; the
finishes stay, because balances count them.
