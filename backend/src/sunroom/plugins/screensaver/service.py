"""The screensaver's photos and where they come from (PLAN §9, §11.3, §11.4; UX §4 "Photos room",
"Screensaver"; ADR 0009).

The pictures are core's (``photos``): phones upload into the library, and this plugin's sources
import into it, each under its own ``source_key`` ("inbox"; later "source:<id>" for Immich and
Nextcloud). The **manifest** is what the wall's screensaver shows: every library photo that isn't
hidden or removed, newest first, with the plugin's settings.

The one source in this milestone is the **inbox**, a folder on the volume
(``$DATA_DIR/photos/inbox``). Every 5 minutes, and when a parent taps Check now, each photo file
at its top that has sat still for 10 seconds (by the file system's clock: a file still being
copied waits) is re-encoded into the library, which drops its EXIF and GPS, and the original
moves to ``inbox/imported/``. A file that isn't a photo Sunroom can read, or is over 50 MB, moves
to ``inbox/unreadable/``; a full disk stops the check and leaves the files for next time. A bad
file never stops the plugin. Each file is re-encoded first and then stored in its own short
write transaction, so the rest of the app never waits on the encoding.

The source's ``last_error`` is the last check's plain line about the files it handled; a check
that found nothing keeps it, so a parent still sees it later (Check now always says afresh).

Live events: ``photos.changed`` when photos came in; ``screensaver.changed {source_id}`` when a
source changed. The 5-minute check stays quiet unless it found something or its line changed.
