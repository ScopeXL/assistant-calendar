"""The week's meals and the saved meals (PLAN §9, §11.3; UX §4 "Meals room", §5 "Meals").

An entry is one meal in one spot: a day, a slot (Dinner unless the family plans more) and a
position (a second dinner the same day is position 1). One live entry holds a spot (a partial
unique index), so whatever takes a spot first moves the one there out: into Recently removed
when a meal replaces it (Undo puts it back), or into the moved one's old spot for Swap days.

Typing a meal keeps it as a saved meal, or counts one more use of the saved meal with that name,
so next week it's one tap; picking a saved meal brings its emoji and recipe link along. Saved
meals carry the ingredients "Add ingredients to Groceries" sends to Lists: the app does that
through the lists API, since a plugin never touches another's tables (ADR 0002).

Every change publishes ``meals.changed {days}`` from its write transaction: the days it touched,
none for a saved meal. Times come from ``ctx.now()``; "today" is the household's.
