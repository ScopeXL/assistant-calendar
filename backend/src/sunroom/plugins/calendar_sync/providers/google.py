"""Google Calendar (PLAN §8.1, ADR 0004): a small REST client and the provider built on it.

Two ways in, both two-way, both for the scope ``https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar``:

* **The helper** (a service account). The family uploads its JSON key once and shares calendars
  with its address. Sunroom signs a one-hour JWT with the key (RS256) and trades it for an
  access token. Nothing expires on the family's side.
* **Sign in with Google.** The standard web flow with PKCE gives a refresh token, traded for
  access tokens as they run out. Google revoking it (``invalid_grant``) means signing in again.

A client of our own rather than Google's libraries (ADR 0024): every request goes through the
plugin's guarded HTTP client, which checks the address, pins the connection, caps the size and
times out. Google's hosts are constants here, and redirects are never followed, so a bearer
token can't travel on to another host.

Reading, in the core's terms (``calendar/synced.py``):

* A recurring event (the master) and its changed occurrences (exceptions: events with
  ``recurringEventId`` and ``originalStartTime``) are one series, keyed by the iCalUID. A
  cancelled exception is a cancelled occurrence (it becomes an EXDATE).
* ``events.list`` with ``showDeleted`` and ``singleEvents=false`` lists masters and exceptions;
  its sync token makes the next listing only what changed. A token Google has forgotten (410)
  means reading the whole calendar again (``complete``).
* A stored series is replaced whole when its master arrives, so a recurring master that changed
  is read again with all its exceptions (``events.list`` by iCalUID). Exceptions that changed on
  their own become a partial series (``master`` None), after one look at their master for its
  iCalUID, zone and etag. Occurrences whose series lives in another calendar (an invitation to
  one of them) are events of their own.

Pushing edits Google's own copy: get it, change what Sunroom keeps (title, notes, place, times,
repeats), put it back with ``If-Match``. Guests, reminders, colors and video links stay. Changed
occurrences are put to their instance ids; cancelled ones go out as EXDATEs.

Failures become ``SyncError``s in plain English that never carry a token, a key, an address or
an event's text.
