"""The provider contract (PLAN §8.1): one protocol, one implementation per kind of account.

A provider lists an account's calendars, reports what changed in one of them since a cursor,
and pushes a local change or a removal. It speaks to servers only through the plugin's guarded
HTTP client (``PluginHttp``; ADR 0024), and turns every failure into a ``SyncError`` whose
``kind`` the engine acts on and whose message a parent can read.
