"""Countdowns and birthdays (PLAN §9, §11.3; UX §4 "Countdowns room", §8).

A countdown is a day the family looks forward to. A one-off counts down to its date and leaves
for Recently removed the day after (the hourly ``tidy``); a yearly one counts down to its next
date every year, its ``date`` being the first. Birthdays aren't rows: while the ``birthdays``
setting is on, each person's birthday in Family comes round by itself. The day arithmetic is
domain/countdowns.py, and "today" is the household's.

A countdown with ``show_on_display`` off is a surprise: the wall screen never lists it, and it
stays off the calendar. Every change publishes ``countdowns.changed {id}`` from its write
transaction.
