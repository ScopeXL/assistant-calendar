"""First run (PLAN §12.1, §13.4; ADR 0006).

Until setup is done, the app's pages send everyone to /setup, and the wall screen shows where to
set it up instead. ``POST /api/setup`` is public only until it succeeds; after that it answers
410 forever. In one transaction it stores the household password (scrypt), names the household,
sets its time zone, marks it onboarded and signs in the phone that ran it, as a parent. The rest
of the wizard (people, the PIN, pairing the screen) uses the normal signed-in routes.

With APP_PASSWORD set, the wizard skips choosing a password but must be given that password, so
an unconfigured server reachable by strangers can't be claimed by the first visitor
(PLAN §17 risk 10).
