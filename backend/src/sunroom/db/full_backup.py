"""Download everything, and reading it back (PLAN §13.7; docs/RESTORE.md).

One zip, ``sunroom-YYYY-MM-DD.zip`` (the household's date), holding exactly:

    sunroom.db                     a fresh verified copy of the database, deflated
    photos/library/<id>.webp       the photos as they are (WebP doesn't shrink further)
    photos/thumbs/<id>.webp
    photos/avatars/<id>.webp
    manifest.json                  what it is: format, versions, when, counts

Never ``photos/inbox/`` or ``photos/.orphans/``, and never the secret key: it stays on the server,
so a lost zip can't sign anyone in or unlock a connected account. ``sunroom restore`` accepts
these names and nothing else.

Memory stays flat on a Pi: a worker thread writes the zip in 64 KB chunks to the event loop, at
most a few waiting at a time, so a slow phone holds the worker back instead of filling memory.
The only thing written to disk is the database copy, under ``backups/.download/``; it goes as
soon as it is in the zip, or however the download ends (an error, the phone going away).
